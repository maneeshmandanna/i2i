# Requirements Document - Image-to-Image MVP

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a web-based image-to-image processing application specifically designed for apparel photography transformation. The application will transform mannequin-based apparel images into realistic human model images in various settings and lighting conditions using fal.ai workflows. The system will be deployed on Vercel with a modular configuration approach for easy workflow updates.

## Project Scope

**Primary Use Case**: Transform apparel images shot on mannequins to realistic human models in different settings and lighting conditions

**Target Users**: Fashion brands, e-commerce businesses, and apparel photographers

**Deployment Platform**: Vercel (full compatibility required)

**Processing Backend**: fal.ai API integration with modular workflow configuration

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Secure User Authentication and Access Control

   - Model demographics options (if supported by workflow)
3. WHEN a user wants to use reference images THEN the system SHALL provide URL input fields for fal.ai multi-image workflows
4. WHEN reference URLs are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and preview reference images before processing
5. WHEN a user initiates processing THEN the system SHALL submit images with all configured parameters to fal.ai workflow
6. WHEN processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL display basic status indicators (Processing, Complete, Error)
7. WHEN fal.ai processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL retrieve and store the transformed images
8. WHEN processing generates results THEN the system SHALL display before/after image comparisons with applied parameters
9. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and allow retry options with parameter adjustments
10. WHEN multiple images are processed THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent processing efficiently with individual parameter sets
